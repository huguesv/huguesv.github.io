Welcome to my updated personal web site.

For the first time in over 20 years, I'm switching away from ASP.NET.

This new version of the site is static pages built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

The benefit of this new setup is that hosting is free on GitHub Pages, and it includes
support for custom domain and https.

There's less content than there was on the old site. I might add some of it back in the future.

I'm also using the default Jekyll 'minima' theme for now, I haven't had time to research available themes yet.
